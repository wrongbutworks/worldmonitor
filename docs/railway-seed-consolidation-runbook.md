# Railway Seed Consolidation Runbook

**Date:** 2026-04-10
**PR:** #2891
**Current services:** 100 (at Railway limit)
**Target services:** 65 (~35 slots freed)

> **Single source of truth for Railway-deployed scripts:** `scripts/railway-services.json`.
> When adding a new Railway service (nixpacks or Dockerfile), add an entry to the
> registry before merging. Both `tests/scripts-railway-nixpacks-no-escape-import.test.mts`
> and `tests/dockerfile-digest-notifications-imports.test.mjs` derive their entry
> lists from the registry, and `tests/railway-services-registry-coverage.test.mts`
> fails if a `Dockerfile.*` CMD, runbook "Start command:" entry, or standalone
> service row references a script the registry doesn't know about. The
> scripts-root guard also conservatively scans unregistered legacy seeders.

## Deployment safety guardrails

### Watch paths are a live contract, and an unreliable one

Railway stores watch paths in each service's environment configuration, not in
the repository. The repo-side contract is
`scripts/railway-services.json`: every registry-managed production seeder pins
its cron and the exact repository-relative files in its runtime dependency
closure. `tests/railway-watch-path-audit.test.mjs` walks each entry point's
imports and fails when that closure grows without a matching registry update.
This keeps the declared closure complete without making unrelated changes under
`scripts/**` or `shared/**` rebuild every seeder.

**A complete closure does not make the filter reliable.** Railway refuses pushes
that plainly match the glob and records the refusal only as a deployment whose
status is `SKIPPED` and whose `meta.commitHash` carries the commit it refused.
Measured 2026-08-04 against production, 62 of the 62 repository-backed services
carrying a filter were behind a push Railway had refused, while
13 of the 15 without one were at `origin/main` HEAD. Narrowness did not help:
`seed-conflict-intel` pins the most careful closure in the fleet — 24 exact
paths — and had its worst skip rate, 51% of its last 500 deployments.

Clearing the filters fleet-wide was considered and rejected on cost: roughly 75
build-minutes per push to main across 77 services at ~30 merges a day, and three
always-on services (ais-relay, notification-relay, scenario-worker) would
restart on every merge, dropping the AIS websocket connections among them. So
the closures stay for now,
what ships today is **detection** ([Deploy-drift check](#deploy-drift-check)
below), and the permanent fix is to move change detection out of Railway
entirely — compute which services' closures actually changed in CI and call
`railway redeploy` for exactly those, so the matching happens in code we own and
test. That is tracked in
[#6142](https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor/issues/6142). The full
measurement and the history behind it are in
[Railway watch paths skip deployments, however narrow the pattern](solutions/integration-issues/railway-seeder-watch-paths-can-skip-deployments.md).

The always-on bootstrap publisher is the deliberate exception: its empty watch
path list means Railway watches the whole repository. That broader trigger
covers its Dockerfile and future bootstrap inputs without rebuilding the cron
seeder fleet.

`scripts/audit-railway-watch-paths.mjs` compares the registry with live
production configuration. It reports exact watch-path and cron drift, missing
registered services, and missing required source-routing variables. Apply mode
refuses a partial mutation while a service or required variable is absent.

After linking the CLI to the `world-monitor` production environment, audit the
live settings with:

```bash
node scripts/audit-railway-watch-paths.mjs
```

To reconcile only drifted seeders and verify the read-back:

```bash
node scripts/audit-railway-watch-paths.mjs --apply
```

The apply mode changes only drifted `build.watchPatterns`,
`build.dockerfilePath` and `deploy.cronSchedule` fields, uses one environment
config commit, and waits for
Railway's eventually consistent config read-back before reporting success. It
does not assign a cron to explicitly always-on services such as the bootstrap
publisher, while still auditing their watch paths and required environment.
Run the audit after adding or replacing a standalone seeder, changing a bundle
dependency, or changing a production cron.

The audit only proves the trigger config matches the registry. Proving a merge
actually reached production is the separate
[deploy-drift check](#deploy-drift-check) below.

The scheduled operational-acceptance workflow performs the same audit in
read-only mode, then the deploy-drift check, before checking compact health.
Create the dedicated GitHub
Actions environment `ingestion-acceptance-production`, restrict its deployment
branch policy to `main`, and configure:

- environment secret `RAILWAY_PRODUCTION_TOKEN`: a Railway project token scoped
  to the production environment;
- environment variable `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID`: the `world-monitor` project ID.

Do not define the Railway token as a repository or organization secret:
`workflow_dispatch` can target another ref, while the environment's server-side
branch policy keeps the production credential unavailable there. The workflow
references the environment with deployment tracking disabled, maps the project
token to the CLI's standard `RAILWAY_TOKEN` variable only for the link and audit
steps, links only inside the ephemeral runner, and never passes `--apply`. Do not
use the broader account-scoped `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN`. Missing or inaccessible
context intentionally fails the acceptance run rather than silently skipping
the live audit.

### Bootstrap R2 publisher contract

The public bootstrap tiers use the dedicated private bucket
`worldmonitor-bootstrap`. Managed `r2.dev` access stays disabled and the bucket
has no custom domain; clients continue to enter through `/api/bootstrap` so the
WAF, origin policy, rate limits, telemetry, and future access controls remain in
the request path.

This service is an always-on publisher, not a Railway cron. Configure it with
`Dockerfile.publish-bootstrap-tiers` (the root application Dockerfile does not
contain the publisher) and start command
`node scripts/publish-bootstrap-tiers.mjs --loop`, **no cron schedule**, and
an empty watch-path list (whole-repository watching). It publishes both tiers
on startup, then fast every two minutes and slow every ten minutes. Keep Redis
authoritative: until the publisher and later rollout gates pass,
`/api/bootstrap` continues to serve its existing Redis assembly.

The environment contract is deliberately split by consumer:

| Scope | Variables | Install in | Capability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shared routing and tier shape | `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, optional `R2_ENDPOINT`, `R2_BOOTSTRAP_BUCKET=worldmonitor-bootstrap`, `IRAN_EVENTS_ENABLED` | Railway production and Vercel production | Names plus the feature flag that controls `iranEvents` tier membership; values must match |
| Publisher | `R2_BOOTSTRAP_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Railway production publisher only | Publisher can PUT and GET only in `worldmonitor-bootstrap` |
| Edge reader | `R2_BOOTSTRAP_READ_KEY_ID`, `R2_BOOTSTRAP_READ_SECRET` | Vercel production only | Edge can GET; it cannot PUT or DELETE, and cannot read `worldmonitor-data` |

Preview and development do not receive either credential; missing credentials
must use the Redis path. The publisher must not fall back to any
`CLOUDFLARE_R2_*` account, bucket, key, secret, or API token. Never copy the
publisher credential into Vercel or the edge credential into Railway, and never
add a `VITE_` alias for any bootstrap R2 credential. Set
`IRAN_EVENTS_ENABLED` explicitly to the same value in both production services;
otherwise the publisher and edge handler resolve different tier contents.

Provision and release in this order:

1. Create the repo-root Railway service, install only the shared and publisher
   variables above, and confirm the live watch paths and lack of a cron schedule.
2. Deploy the publisher before enabling shadow measurement or serving from R2.
3. Parse both `fast.json` and `slow.json`, then verify `generatedAt` advances in
   two successive publishes for each tier.
4. Install only the shared and read-only variables in Vercel production. Keep
   them absent from preview and development.
5. Run the negative permission probes: publisher cannot access
   `worldmonitor-data`; edge cannot write/delete in `worldmonitor-bootstrap` and
   cannot read `worldmonitor-data`.

Rotate one consumer at a time: create a replacement token, update that consumer,
verify its publish or read with the replacement, then revoke the old token. On
suspected compromise, revoke first; Redis fallback preserves availability while
a replacement is issued. Never log, commit, or copy credential values into an
incident note.

### Merged does not mean deployed

`.github/workflows/seed-freshness-monitor.yml` runs every 15 minutes on the
default branch. Scheduled runs first require the latest `main` commit's `gate`
status to be green; a missing, pending, or failed gate makes the workflow fail
closed instead of producing a green skipped run. Manual runs execute directly.
After the repository gate, the workflow checks live Railway watch paths, cron
schedules, required routing variables, and service presence against
`scripts/railway-services.json`, then runs the deploy-drift check, then checks
public compact health. It fails on
every actionable problem, including `SEED_ERROR`, `STALE_SEED`,
`STALE_CONTENT`, and degraded composed coverage. Statuses that explicitly end
in `_ON_DEMAND` remain informational. It deliberately does not run on an
ingestion push because Railway may not have deployed or executed that revision
yet. This is the operational acceptance gate for the "merged and green, but
production data is still unhealthy or running under stale deployment
controls" gap.

#### Deploy-drift check

```bash
node scripts/check-railway-deploy-drift.mjs        # add --json for the machine-readable form
```

The watch-path filter is one way a merge fails to reach production; a GitHub
integration that stopped delivering (#6064) and a build that failed after the
merge landed are others. This check is deliberately agnostic about which. For
every service whose Railway source is this repository it takes the newest
deployment that actually reached a running state, reads `meta.commitHash` off
it, and compares that with main's head. Three verdicts are healthy — `CURRENT`,
`AHEAD`, `PENDING_BUILD` — and the problem set is derived from them by negation,
so the reported verdicts are `REJECTED_PUSH`, `BEHIND`, `BUILD_FAILED`,
`UNKNOWN_SOURCE`, `UNKNOWN_STATUS`, `NO_DEPLOYMENTS`, `NO_BUILD_IN_WINDOW` and
`QUERY_FAILED`. The file's header comment and exported constants are the exact
semantics. `REJECTED_PUSH` is the filter rejection this runbook's watch-path
section describes: the named SHAs are merges Railway refused.

Ancestry is answered with `git merge-base --is-ancestor`, which needs the
commits present locally: the workflow checks out with `fetch-depth: 50` and
re-fetches main before the step. An unanswerable question reports the service
rather than excusing it.

Accepted degradations go in `scripts/railway-deploy-drift-baseline.json`, each
with an owner issue and the whole file with an expiry, split by the same
`applyAcceptanceBaseline` that `scripts/check-seed-freshness.mjs` applies to
compact health — so expiry, prune-on-recovery, and "a service failing with a
different verdict than the one baselined still blocks" cannot acquire two
meanings. Today it holds the measured fleet: 62 `REJECTED_PUSH` entries against
[#6142](https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor/issues/6142) plus `umami` at
`BEHIND` against #6064. Those are printed on every run as `acknowledged` and do
not fail it, so a green monitor here means "nothing new went stale", not "every
service is on head". The list should shrink as #6142 lands; a service that
recovers is printed as `recovered` — prune it.

#### Recovering a stale service

Do not use `railway redeploy` to recover a bad or stale source deployment.
Railway documents redeploy as rebuilding the most recent deployment with the
same code, so it cannot pick up a newer fixed commit. Upload the source from a
**clean detached worktree at `origin/main`**, never from your own worktree:
`railway up` uploads the current working directory, so an unclean one deploys
uncommitted state to production.

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add --detach /tmp/railway-deploy origin/main
cd /tmp/railway-deploy
git rev-parse HEAD                       # must equal origin/main
railway up --service <service-name> --environment production --detach
```

An upload carries no commit SHA, so `check-railway-deploy-drift.mjs` reports
that service as `UNKNOWN_SOURCE` until the next git-triggered build replaces it.
That is expected after a recovery upload, not a second failure.

Alternatively, Railway's dashboard **Deploy Latest Commit** action deploys the
latest commit from the service's default GitHub branch — preferable when the
service's git source is healthy, because the resulting deployment carries a SHA
the drift check can compare. After either recovery path, verify the deployment
commit SHA and the relevant compact-health problem
have both advanced. See Railway's official
[redeploy CLI reference](https://docs.railway.com/cli/redeploy) and
[deployment actions reference](https://docs.railway.com/deployments/deployment-actions).

`railway run` is also not production-network evidence: Railway documents it as
executing locally after injecting service variables. For an immediate long-cron
backfill, use a controlled temporary Railway cron execution, verify its terminal
run plus seed metadata and compact health, then restore the captured command and
schedule and rerun the operational-config audit. The full rollback-safe sequence
is documented in
[A merged seeder fix is not live until its cron fires](solutions/integration-issues/merged-is-not-ran-long-cron-seeders.md).

## How It Works

Each "bundle" is a single Railway cron service that replaces N individual services. The bundle script spawns each member seed sequentially via `child_process.execFile`, checking Redis `seed-meta:` timestamps to skip seeds that ran recently. Original seed scripts are unchanged.

The `derived-signals` bundle also owns the final China composition
(`seed-china-decision-signals.mjs`). It runs after the cross-Strait source lane,
calls the public six-domain RPC, publishes
`intelligence:china-decision-signals:v1`, and records
`seed-meta:intelligence:china-decision-signals`. It does not add providers or
recompute any source-domain method. Before rollout, run
`node scripts/audit-china-decision-parity.mjs`; after staging is deployed, pass
`--require-live --url <public-staging-api-base>`. Against production that live
probe is already enforced every six hours by
`.github/workflows/china-decision-parity-live.yml`, so the manual run is for
pre-production environments that workflow does not reach. The probe output is
intentionally sanitized to reachability, latency, generation time, and group
states.

**Graceful fetch failures:** `runSeed` now treats transient upstream fetch
failures as non-zero graceful failures after extending the last-good Redis TTL.
This applies to bundled members and standalone `runSeed` cron seeders: Railway
may mark that cron run failed, but `/api/health` and seed-contract probes still
read the preserved `seed-meta:` freshness. Alerting should either tolerate these
transient cron failures or key sustained data-health pages off those freshness
checks. Bundle member logs use `status=GRACEFUL_FAIL`; external log consumers
that match only `status=FAILED` should include `GRACEFUL_FAIL`. The bundle
summary still reports these under `failed:N`, so use per-section status when
distinguishing graceful upstream outages from hard failures.

**Standalone follow-up:** `scripts/seed-military-flights.mjs` and
`scripts/seed-service-statuses.mjs` still have manual graceful failure paths
that exit `0`. Track those separately if the standalone graceful-failure
contract needs to be made fully uniform beyond shared `runSeed` users.

**Per-bundle migration:**

1. Delete ONE old member first (to free a slot under the 100 limit)
2. Create the bundle service on Railway
3. Wait 2-3 cron cycles, verify `/api/health` shows OK for all member seeds
4. Delete remaining old member services
5. Monitor 24h before proceeding to next bundle

**Rollback:** Delete the bundle service, re-create individual services. Scripts are unchanged in the repo.

## Services to CREATE (11 total)

All new services share these settings:

- **Root directory:** `.` (repo root, so `npm ci` installs all deps)
- **Build command:** (default nixpacks, uses `scripts/nixpacks.toml`)
- **Source branch:** `main`
- **Resources:** 1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM
- **NODE_OPTIONS:** `--dns-result-order=ipv4first`

**Watch paths:** Use `scripts/**`, `shared/**` for all bundles. `scripts/**` covers all seed scripts and their helpers. `shared/**` is needed because `loadSharedConfig()` in `_seed-utils.mjs` resolves `../shared/` (repo root) before `./shared/` (scripts dir), so config JSON files like `country-names.json`, `iso3-to-iso2.json`, and others live at the repo root `shared/` directory. Without `shared/**`, config-only edits won't trigger redeploys.

| **Required variable** | `USPTO_API_KEY=${{shared.USPTO_API_KEY}}` |

Defense Patents is an intentional data-series migration, not a continuation of
the former grant/issue series. USPTO ODP Patent File Wrapper records represent
applications, so `date` is the application filing date and `abstract` remains
empty for wire compatibility. The producer marks the discontinuity with
`sourceVersion: uspto-odp-v1` and `schemaVersion: 2`; operational comparisons
must not treat pre-migration grant dates and post-migration filing dates as one
continuous metric.

| **Cron schedule** | `*/5 * * * *` (every 5 min) |

| **Net savings** | 1 slot |
| **Members** | Correlation (5min), Cross-Source Signals (15min), Cross-Strait Activity (3h), China Decision Signals (15min), Regional Snapshots (6h) |
| **Required env** | `JAPAN_MOD_PROXY_URL` or `PROXY_URL` (Cross-Strait Activity's Japan MOD exit; the section declares an any-of group, so either satisfies it and only an environment with neither fails as `CONFIG_ERROR`) |
| **Note** | Cross-Strait Activity is the only direct external-source member; it uses bounded MND/Japan MOD requests and a 3h freshness gate. China Decision Signals validates and republishes the bounded public composition after reading its domain lanes. Other members are Redis-derived. The bundle enforces a 570s wall-time admission budget so a non-fitting due section defers before Railway's 10-minute container limit. |

#### Staged correlation runtime modes

Correlation uses one Redis control key, `correlation:runtime-mode:v1`, whose
value is a JSON object with one strict field, for example
`{"mode":"legacy"}`, `{"mode":"exact"}`, or `{"mode":"fuzzy"}`.
The browser reads the public `GET /api/correlation-runtime-mode` contract with
`cache: "no-store"` at startup and before every correlation refresh. The
correlation seeder reads the Redis key again on every compute cycle; it does not
reuse a previous cycle's decision.

Every missing key, malformed JSON or shape, unknown mode, missing Redis
credentials, failed Redis request, non-OK browser response, or failed browser
payload parse resolves to `legacy`. `legacy` remains the current keyword
clustering behavior. Exact entity clustering and fuzzy resolution are staged
follow-ups owned by #5984 and #5989; this control slice does not activate either
mode or change live configuration.

Changing the key is an operational activation or rollback and requires separate
operator approval. Keep that approval, the observed validation evidence, and
the rollback decision outside the code deployment; the code path is only the
fail-closed read and hand-off contract.

#### Japan MOD discovery surface and recovery gate

The official discovery URL is the Japanese Joint Staff homepage,
`https://www.mod.go.jp/js/`. The runtime makes one direct request and, after a
transport failure, one request through `JAPAN_MOD_PROXY_URL` (falling back to
`PROXY_URL`). It never downloads linked PDFs during a scheduled run.

**Japan MOD's Cloudflare rule is path-level, not egress-level.** Measured
2026-08-01, from both direct egress and the configured Decodo path:

| Path | Result |
|---|---|
| `https://www.mod.go.jp/js/` | 200, 33,419 bytes, 9 `/js/pdf/2026/` links |
| `https://www.mod.go.jp/js/pdf/2026/*.pdf` | 200, `application/pdf` |
| `https://www.mod.go.jp/js/press/index-en.html` | 403 `Just a moment...` |
| `https://www.mod.go.jp/js/index-en.html` | 403 |
| `https://www.mod.go.jp/js/index.html` | 403 |
| `https://www.mod.go.jp/js/press/` | 403 |
| `https://www.mod.go.jp/js/en/` | 403 |

Note that `/js/` succeeds while `/js/index.html` does not. Cloudflare fronts the
succeeding path too — the 200 response carries a `window.__CF$cv$params` beacon —
so this is a rule that exempts `/js/`, not a zone the CDN does not cover.
Changing the discovery URL to any other path on this host is a regression, not a
refinement. This is the general lesson for other Japanese government sources:
probe the bare directory before concluding the host is blocked.

**Do not derive an English companion PDF by inserting `e` before `.pdf`.** The
English series carries its own counter, so the mapping resolves to unrelated
releases. Measured 2026-08-01:

| Document | Content |
|---|---|
| `p20260730_01.pdf` (JA) | 中国海軍艦艇の動向について — Chinese Navy, Renhai/Jiangkai II |
| `p20260730_01e.pdf` | "Russian aircraft activity around Japan" (July 27) |
| `p20260730_03e.pdf` | "Chinese Military Activities" — the real counterpart |

That day Japanese published `_01`/`_02` while English published `_01e`–`_05e`.
Every check that mapping would be validated against — HTTP 200,
`application/pdf`, `%PDF` magic, Joint Staff publisher marker — passes on the
*wrong* document, so it cannot be validated into correctness. The correct
counterpart is only resolvable from the English index, which is the surface
Cloudflare blocks. `parseJapanModIndex` therefore accepts only
`/js/pdf/<year>/p<YYYYMMDD>_<NN>.pdf`, which structurally excludes the English
series, and the source reports
`companionResolution: english_index_blocked_no_derivable_companion`.

Discovery records candidates for manual review; it never admits an observation.
`admittedDocumentCount` counts hand-reviewed rows and `unreviewedCandidateCount`
counts the discovered backlog. A 200 carrying no allowlisted release is
`JMOD_INDEX_EMPTY`, not success.

The blocked English index stays wired as `shadowIndexUrl`: a direct probe that
runs at most once per 24 hours, only after the homepage request already
succeeded. It is diagnostic only — it never contributes to `requestCount`,
`errorCodes`, `transportStatus`, or `lastSuccessAt`. Watch
`shadowIndexProbe.status` flip from `blocked` to `reachable`; that is the signal
that English provenance can be restored and the `+e` constraint above revisited.
`candidates` and `shadowIndexProbe` are operator-only and stripped from the
anonymous bootstrap projection.

If a future provider change is needed instead, the concrete external dependency
for the current provider is an active
[Decodo Site Unblocker](https://help.decodo.com/docs/site-unblocker-quick-start)
subscription with source-specific credentials and a successful target test. The
ordinary residential gateway credential is not a substitute for that product. If
the provider requires disabling TLS verification, do not weaken the adapter;
provision a trusted provider CA or use an approved authenticated HTTPS
integration instead.

Recovery is accepted only when:

1. `crossStraitActivityJapanMod` reports `OK` for two consecutive scheduled
   three-hour runs from distinct scheduled executions;
2. `lastSuccessAt` is non-null, later than the deploy, and advances between
   those two successful runs;
3. the published `_seed.sourceVersion` reads
   `taiwan-mnd-html+japan-joint-staff-homepage-v2`, proving the new adapter is
   the code that ran rather than a merged-but-not-deployed PR;
4. the source reports `transportMode: japanese_homepage_candidate_discovery`
   and at least one newly discovered candidate tied to each successful fetch —
   retained rows do not count;
5. the combined cross-Strait publication remains available and explicitly
   source-degraded when a later Japan MOD request fails.

| **Required env** | `PROXY_URL` (required independently by Gulf Quotes / ETF Flows and selected for an exchange only when its source-specific setting is absent) and `RELAY_SHARED_SECRET` (authenticates the fixed `https://api.worldmonitor.app/api/internal/china-exchange-egress` fallback used by China Corporate Disclosures and China Stock Connect after direct/proxy SZSE failures). Proxy configuration precedence is `SSE_PROXY_URL` → `SZSE_PROXY_URL` → `PROXY_URL` for SSE and `SZSE_PROXY_URL` → `PROXY_URL` for SZSE; the process selects the first non-empty setting rather than attempting each URL sequentially. This is the deployment contract; production provisioning and live fallback acceptance require separate verification. |
| **Note** | Crypto Quotes, Stablecoin Markets, ETF Flows, Gulf Quotes, and Token Panels back up ais-relay inline loops. Hyperliquid Flow, China Corporate Disclosures, China Stock Connect, Gold ETF Flows, Gold CB Reserves, SEC CIK Map, and SEC 8-K Stream are primary in this bundle. China Corporate Disclosures reads official metadata only: SSE uses direct then the selected proxy, while SZSE uses direct, distinct port attempts within the selected proxy, then the authenticated fixed edge hop. China Stock Connect reads aggregate exchange statistics over the same ladder and additionally caps every `www.szse.cn` request in a run under one shared 100s wall-clock budget, because its SZSE endpoints are date-keyed and the number of probes depends on how many sessions the exchange has published. Gulf Quotes uses Alpha Vantage (richer than relay's Yahoo-only). |

The bilateral HS4 cron uses `COMTRADE_API_KEYS` and a 480-request hard budget
under the provider's 500-call monthly quota. The authenticated route requests
one four-year window (`Y-2` through `Y-5`) in each of two HS4 batches and keeps
the newest row per product/partner. The public-preview fallback cannot accept
that period list and tries `Y-2`, then `Y-3`. A 24-day freshness gate prevents
accidental repeat runs; health reports `COVERAGE_PARTIAL` below 110 country
shards and stale after 35 days. Country payloads live for 40 days so a missed
monthly tick becomes visible before last-good data expires.

**Not standalone services (documented here to avoid confusion):**

- `scripts/seed-chokepoint-flows.mjs` — spawned in-process by the AIS relay
  (`ais-relay.cjs`), not deployed as its own cron.
- `scripts/seed-military-maritime-news.mjs` — this is the script behind the
  existing `seed-military-maritime` standalone cron (USNI/NGA warm-ping) listed
  in the inventory above.

## Execution Order (recommended)

Start with lowest-risk, highest-savings bundles.

| Order | Bundle | Slots Freed | Risk | Cron Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | seed-bundle-ecb-eu | 3 | Low (daily, same API) | Daily |
| 2 | seed-bundle-static-ref | 3 | Low (weekly, static data) | Weekly |
| 3 | seed-bundle-resilience | 1 | Low (6h, annual window) | 6h |
| 4 | seed-bundle-portwatch | 3 | Medium (hourly, 4 members) | Hourly |
| 5 | seed-bundle-climate | 4 | Medium (3h, 5 members) | 3h |
| 6 | seed-bundle-energy-sources | 5 | Medium (daily, 6 members) | Daily |
| 7 | seed-bundle-macro | 5 | Medium (daily, 6 members) | Daily |
| 8 | seed-bundle-health | 3 | Medium (hourly, 5 members) | Hourly |
| 9 | seed-bundle-derived-signals | 1 | Medium (5min bundle; one bounded 3h external member) | 5min |
| 10 | seed-bundle-market-backup | 4 | Low (backup for relay) | 5min |
| 11 | seed-bundle-relay-backup | 3 | Low (backup for relay) | 30min |

**Running total:** 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 3 = **35 slots freed**

## Verification Checklist (per bundle)

After deploying each bundle and before deleting old services:

- [ ] Bundle service shows "Active" in Railway dashboard
- [ ] First cron fire produced logs (check Railway logs)
- [ ] Logs show expected `[Bundle:X] Starting (N sections)` and `Finished` lines
- [ ] Each member seed shows `Done` or `Skipped` (not all `failed`)
- [ ] `/api/health` shows OK for all member seed-meta keys (not STALE_SEED)
- [ ] Wait at least 2 full cron cycles before deleting old services
- [ ] After deleting old services, verify health still shows OK on next cycle

---

## Env Vars

Each bundle service inherits the same env vars as the individual seeds it replaces. Copy these from any existing seed service in Railway:

- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
- `NODE_OPTIONS=--dns-result-order=ipv4first`
- Plus any API keys used by member seeds (GIE_API_KEY, ICAO_API_KEY, etc.)
- `SAM_GOV_API_KEY` for the Global Tenders SAM.gov adapter. The other initial procurement adapters do not require credentials.

The simplest approach: use Railway's "shared variables" or copy all env vars from the `worldmonitor` (ais-relay) service, which has a superset of all API keys.

## Import-HHI Comtrade 429 Runbook

Issue #3979 covers the residual operational failure mode for the Country Resilience Index `importConcentration` dimension: AE/RU/NO/CH can still remain absent from `resilience:recovery:import-hhi:v1` when UN Comtrade rejects the monthly recovery bundle for key budget, pacing, or reporter metadata reasons.

**Decision:** treat this as Comtrade quota/pacing while the seed logs show HTTP 429 or quota-exhausted HTTP 403 responses. Do not change `importConcentration` scoring until the rate-limit path has been addressed and a force-refresh proves that Comtrade is returning non-quota responses for the watched reporters.

### Controls

Set these on the Railway service that runs `node scripts/seed-bundle-resilience-recovery.mjs`:

| Variable | Default | Use when |
|---|---:|---|
| `COMTRADE_API_KEYS` | required | Add keys first when multiple reporters are missing with 429s or quota-exhausted 403s. |
| `IMPORT_HHI_PER_KEY_DELAY_MS` | `1500` | Increase to `10000`-`15000` if logs still show import-HHI 429s. `PER_KEY_DELAY_MS` is accepted as a legacy alias. |
| `IMPORT_HHI_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | key count | Set to `1` if quota failures look IP-level or global, not per-key. |
| `IMPORT_HHI_VERBOSE` | unset | Set to `1` only for a diagnostic force-refresh; logs per-reporter status. |

Reporter cohort splitting is the last resort. Prefer more `COMTRADE_API_KEYS`, then wider per-key delay, then lower concurrency. The import-HHI seeder fetches the watched #3979 reporters first when they are missing, so a replenished force-refresh should recover AE/RU/NO/CH before unrelated registry backfill can consume the hourly provider budget. Aggressive incident pacing such as `IMPORT_HHI_PER_KEY_DELAY_MS=15000` with `IMPORT_HHI_MAX_CONCURRENCY=1` can exceed the 30-minute bundle window; that mode intentionally relies on checkpoint/resume across ticks, not one-pass completion. Cohort splitting should only be used if a single full pass still exhausts the provider budget after the first three controls.

The import-HHI publish gate requires AE/RU/NO/CH as well as the normal country-count floor. If one of those watched reporters is still absent, the seed run fails validation with `emptyDataIsFailure: true`, does not refresh seed-meta, and leaves the bundle eligible to retry instead of stranding a fresh-but-incomplete canonical payload for the full monthly interval.

If a watched reporter is still missing and the seed log says `status=200 rows=0`, stop treating that reporter as a key-budget problem. Inspect Comtrade reporter metadata, data availability, and query-shape filters (`customsCode`, `motCode`, `cmdCode`) before considering any scoring change. The known non-M49 reporter-code exceptions are pinned in `scripts/shared/comtrade-reporter-overrides.json`; as of the #3979 follow-up this includes Norway (`NO=579`) and Switzerland (`CH=757`). Russia (`RU=643`) currently needs the seed-only stale period fallback (`Y-5..Y-8`) because Comtrade returns zero annual import rows for the standard `Y-1..Y-4` window but still exposes 2018 rows.

### Force-Refresh

After deploying a pacing/key-budget change, bypass the 30-day freshness gate:

```bash
IMPORT_HHI_VERBOSE=1 FORCE_RESEED=true node scripts/seed-recovery-import-hhi.mjs
```

Then warm live scores so `importConcentration` reads the refreshed canonical key:

```bash
API_BASE_URL=https://api.worldmonitor.app \
WORLDMONITOR_SEED_REFRESH_KEY=<seed-refresh-key> \
WORLDMONITOR_API_KEY=<read-key> \
node scripts/seed-resilience-scores.mjs
```

`WORLDMONITOR_SEED_REFRESH_KEY` is required: the resilience score seeder uses it
for the seed-only `get-resilience-ranking?refresh=1` recompute path. Keep
`WORLDMONITOR_API_KEY` or `WORLDMONITOR_VALID_KEYS` available too so laggard
per-country score warms can fall back to the normal premium read endpoint. In
Railway, the service environment should already provide the Upstash Redis
credentials; for a local force-run, export `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and
`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` as well.

If the run is fixing missing interval data, the success signal is the
`seed_complete` log for `domain="resilience:scores"` with
`intervalsWritten > 0` and no `status="ERROR"`. A failed interval recovery
sets `status="ERROR"` plus `intervalFailureReason` and includes the diagnostic
counts `intervalMissingScorePayloadCount`, `intervalStaleScorePayloadCount`,
`intervalInvalidScorePayloadCount`, `intervalMalformedScorePayloadCount`,
`intervalFormulaSkipCount`, and `intervalPayloadSkipCount`.

Verify the public audit surfaces after the run:

```bash
curl -fsS https://api.worldmonitor.app/api/resilience/v1/get-runtime-manifest \
  | jq '{formulaTag, rankingCache, constructVersions, intervals}'
curl -fsS https://api.worldmonitor.app/api/health \
  | jq '.checks.resilienceIntervals'
```

Pass condition for interval recovery: runtime manifest reports
`intervals.available=true`, and `/api/health` reports
`resilienceIntervals.status="OK"` with `records > 0`.

### Verification

Verify both Redis and the live score API:

```bash
WORLDMONITOR_API_KEY=<key> node scripts/verify-import-hhi-coverage.mjs
```

Pass condition for AE/RU/NO/CH:

- `resilience:recovery:import-hhi:v1.countries.<ISO2>` is present.
- `seed-meta:resilience:recovery:import-hhi` is fresh.
- Live `GetResilienceScore` has `importConcentration.coverage > 0`.
- Live `importConcentration.imputationClass` is empty.

If the live API key is not available during Redis-only triage, use:

```bash
IMPORT_HHI_VERIFY_REDIS_ONLY=1 node scripts/verify-import-hhi-coverage.mjs
```

Redis-only verification is not sufficient to close #3979; it only confirms that the seeder recovered the canonical payload before score warmup.
